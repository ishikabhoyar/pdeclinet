## 1. What Is DeCliNet? (Vision & Value)

### The Problem
- *Medical research is slow, data is siloed, and patients rarely control or benefit from sharing their data.*
- *Clinical trials struggle to find participants and are often untransparent or costly.*
- *Researchers face funding bottlenecks and a lack of global collaboration.*

### DeCliNet’s Solution
- **A global, decentralized platform** for sharing anonymized patient data, running privacy-preserving health AI, and funding life-saving research collectively.
- *Patients* contribute data while controlling privacy/consent and get rewarded.
- *Researchers* access richer, verifiable data and decentralized funding.
- *The community* governs the platform through tokens and DAOs.

## 2. How DeCliNet Works (Project Architecture)

### High-Level System Components

| Layer                | Description                                                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Layer**       | Encrypted patient health data, IoT/device feeds, EHRs, stored on-chain/off-chain|
| **Smart Contracts**  | Manage data access, contributor rewards, research bounties, funding DAO         |
| **AI Module/API**    | Federated and privacy-preserving ML for research, diagnostic, and analytics     |
| **User Interface**   | Web/mobile dApp: data upload, consent, research dashboard, funding portal       |
| **Governance Layer** | DAO voting on funding proposals, platform upgrades, dispute resolution          |

## 3. Detailed Feature Explanation

### A. Patient Data Sharing (Privacy-First)
- Patients register, upload or stream encrypted health data (EHR, fitness, wearable sensors, DNA).
- They set detailed privacy choices (who can access, for what purpose, for how long).
- Data is stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin, BNB Greenfield), with hashes on-chain for integrity.

### B. Decentralized Clinical Research Funding (DeSci)
- Anyone can propose a research project (e.g., COVID trial, diabetes AI study).
- DAO members (token holders) vote to allocate community funds—using quadratic voting to encourage diverse support.
- All funding, spending, and outcomes are recorded on-chain for transparency.

### C. AI/ML Health Analytics (Federated, Zero-Knowledge)
- Researchers submit data analysis or ML model requests.
- Federated learning: Patient data never leaves their control—AI models are trained where the data lives, only results are shared.
- Zero-knowledge proofs and advanced cryptography validate results without revealing raw data.

### D. Clinical Trial Matching & Management
- Researchers post trial participation opportunities.
- AI matches eligible patients, notifies them, and manages consent and onboarding.
- All consents and trial events are immutable, transparent, and auditable.

### E. Data Rewarding and Tokenomics
- Patients who contribute useful, validated data earn DCNET tokens.
- Tokenomics: Token used for rewards, funding votes, and platform upgrades.

## 4. Step-by-Step Technical Roadmap

### Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment
- Learn basics of blockchain and smart contracts (Aptos, BNB, Ethereum all valid).
- Install Move CLI and Aptos CLI ([Guide]).[1][2]
- Set up testnet wallet and sample account.

### Step 2: Design the Smart Contract System
- Define Move modules for:  
  - Data Contribution & Hash Storage  
  - Consent & Access Control  
  - Funding/DAO/Proposal Management  
  - Reward Distribution & Token Logic
- Write unit tests using Move’s built-in testing framework.

### Step 3: Off-Chain Data Storage (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin)
- Store sensitive health data off-chain for scalability.
- Record file hashes and access permissions on-chain for verification.

### Step 4: Build the Frontend dApp
- Choice: React or Next.js for web, Flutter/React Native for mobile.
- Connect to wallet (e.g., Martian, Petra for Aptos).
- Progressive onboarding: Separate screens for patients, researchers, funders.

### Step 5: AI/ML Integration  
- For MVP: Use python notebooks or Google Colab for federated model demo.
- For production: Wrap ML code in microservices, connect output to blockchain for logging.

### Step 6: Launch Governance DAO
- Create a simple DAO contract for voting on funding, data policy, and upgrades.
- Voting rights (DCNET token) proportional to contribution and reputation.

### Step 7: Deploy & Test
- Deploy contracts to Aptos testnet or devnet.
- Simulate user flows: data upload, research proposal, voting, reward distribution.
- Test security: Verify consent logic, prevent unauthorized access, audit logs.

### Step 8: Prepare Documentation & Onboarding
- Write simple, step-by-step docs for each major use case and a flowchart for beginners.
- Q&A and community support features (Discord, Telegram integration).

## 5. Building DeCliNet on Aptos: Beginner-Focused (Move Language, Web3 Stack)

### Required Tools
- **Aptos CLI** — Manages blockchain interaction ([Setup Guide])[2][3]
- **Move Language** — Smart contract programming ([Tutorial])[4][1]
- **React/Next.js** — User-facing website/dApp
- **IPFS/Filecoin SDK** — Secure data storage

### Example: Move Smart Contract Flow

```rust
module DeCliNet::PatientData {
    struct PatientRecord has key { owner: address, data_hash: vector<u8> }

    public entry fun submit_data(account: &signer, data_hash: vector<u8>) {
        move_to(account, PatientRecord { owner: signer::address_of(account), data_hash });
    }
    // Add consent management and reward logic here
}
```

*Above: a basic outline for storing patient data hash and ownership. Expand for consent and access control.*

## 6. How Users Interact (Beginner Flows)

**A. Patient Flow**
1. Register with the dApp; connect wallet
2. Upload health data (EHR, fitband, DNA file) — it’s encrypted & stored off-chain
3. Set sharing and reward preferences (e.g., “approve for diabetes research only”)
4. Optionally, join clinical studies and receive DCNET tokens

**B. Researcher Flow**
1. Register as a verified researcher
2. Browse available datasets (only with proper permissions)
3. Submit research/funding proposal, get DAO votes
4. Use federated AI to request model runs—never access raw personal data directly
5. Publish validated results (on-chain hash, off-chain storage)

**C. Funder/DAO Member**
1. Buy or earn DCNET tokens
2. Vote in DAO to support projects, approve new features, or update policies

***

## 7. Security & Privacy Considerations

- All raw data is off-chain, access is cryptographically controlled
- Use zero-knowledge proofs and/or federated learning for privacy
- Patient can revoke access at any time
- All access, consent, research, and funding events are recorded immutably
- Ensure compliance with HIPAA/GDPR

***

## 8. Tokenomics, Incentives, and Governance

- **DCNET Token:**
  - Reward for useful health data contributions
  - Used for DAO governance (votes for research funding, upgrades)
- **Quadratic Funding:** Ensures grassroots research gets support, not just whales
- **Reputation Systems:** Contributors and researchers build reputation for trust

***

## 9. Summary & Next Steps

**DeCliNet democratizes medical research by putting patients, researchers, and funders in a decentralized, privacy-first ecosystem leveraging AI and blockchain.**

### For Beginners:
- Start by learning Move smart contracts (great tutorials and videos available)
- Follow dApp development best practices ([guide])[2]
- Use public datasets (or mock data) for local testing
- Collaborate! Assign roles (frontend, smart contract, ML, documentation)

### Suggested Immediate Steps:
1. Sketch your MVP screens and major user flows.
2. Assign research: one on Move, one on frontend, one on healthcare data security.
3. Write and deploy a sample smart contract for data registration.
4. Build your docs as you go—screenshots, code snippets, and plain-language guides.
